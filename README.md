# Travel-Insurance-Purchase-Prediction-Pipeline
This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to purchase a travel insurance package. Using a historical dataset from a tour and travel company, we employ data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and advanced machine learning techniques including ensemble modeling.
